# Complain-Management-System
This is just a complaint management system I had programmed in my class 12

This Complaint Management
program is a project which
helps the people list their
complaint and categorize them
on the basis of their usage
in order to make it easier
for the organization to help
them. It is a compact and a
quick method to voice the
peopleâ€™s problems.


## Abstract 

This project initially gives the user
to choose between the admin or a
customer mode.

The customer mode can be accessed by
only the users and it allows them to
enter their complaint and display them.
It also allows them to alter their
complaint if they have made some
mistake

The admin mode can only be accessed
using a username and a password. It
includes all the functions of the
customer mode in addition to other
functions like deletion and alteration
of the entered complaints.

Both the modes also contain an
instruction menu containing all the
information regarding this management
system.
